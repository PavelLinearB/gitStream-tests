            🚨 **Warning: Approaching Monthly Automation Limit**
            **Monthly PRs automated: 920/1000**
            Your organization has used over 90% of its monthly quota for gitStream automations. Once the quota is reached, new pull requests for this month will not trigger gitStream automations and will be marked as “Skipped.”
            To avoid interruptions, consider optimizing your automation usage or upgrading your plan by [contacting LinearB](https://linearb.io/book-a-demo).
